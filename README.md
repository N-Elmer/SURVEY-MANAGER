## Code Explanation

The Survey Manager web application is implemented using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. Here's a breakdown of the different components:

- **JavaScript (React)**: The frontend is implemented using React. The components in the `src/pages` folder handle the main functionalities of the application. The `src/utils/api.js` file contains functions for making API requests to the backend.

- **Flask**: The backend is implemented in the `backend/app.py` file. It handles the routing and API endpoints for the application.

- **CSS**: The styles for the application are defined in the `src/App.css` and `src/index.css` files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors while using the Survey Manager web application, consider the following:

- Double-check that all the necessary files and folders are present in the correct locations, as described in the folder structure section.

- Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system, and the required dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, and the required dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.

- Verify that the database file `survey.db` is initialized and located in the `backend` folder.
